You can download and play the game [here](https://caioguedes.itch.io/thin-ice)!

This game was done in my free time over the course of 2 weeks on a personal project, you can read more about it [here](https://caioguedes.itch.io/thin-ice/devlog/268154/biweekly-games-game-2-postmortem).

This was made in the Unity game engine and using Blender for light 3d modeling.
